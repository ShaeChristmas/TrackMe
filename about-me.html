        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a keen Software Development Student, aiming for a High Distinction in this
            unit.<br><br>
            As far as Hobbies and Interests go, I'm an avid gamer, mostly playing sandbox or survival style games.<br>
            I'm also very interested in the future of computing and programming systems, mainly looking at the commercial/industry uses for quantum systems,<br>
            and programming languages for a qubit based computer.<br>
            At the End of my Honours, I am hoping to be able to do a PhD, however i haven't decided what area i would like to research in just yet.<br>
            I really enjoy studying at Uni, and am always looking for any interesting side projects to work on as well.<br>
        </p>
